-- Implementation of all Integers, not just natural numbers via the Peano axioms
-- Names in this file may clash with the defaults/bultins in Haskell libraries,
-- but this file is for taking notes and doing homework and not use as a library
-- (for this reason no traits/typeclasses are even mentioned, to keep focus on
-- data and algorithm rather than grouping of said algorithms)
--
-- Some things have been ported (?) from Rust's Peano library

import Prelude (Show, undefined)

-- An integer can be 0, the successor of another integer (which may or may not
-- be zero), or the predecessor of another integer (which also may or may not be
-- zero)

-- See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_definition (also called inductive
-- definition) for more details.
